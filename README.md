You will need to install the snekfetch dependency for the command to work properly.

```
npm install snekfetch
```
Clearly you must call the module within the code, You can find the package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snekfetch)

Or the [official website](https://snekfetch.js.org) and read the docs

If u have problems u can dm me on twitter or discord ;)
this is just a base, u can use other dependency
